# Showkeys Overlay

The showkeys overlay displays your keyboard input on screen in real-time, making TUIOS ideal for presentations, screencasts, and live coding demos. When enabled, every key you press appears in a clean overlay at the bottom of the screen.

<Callout type="info">
Showkeys solves a common problem in terminal screencasts: viewers can't see what keys you're pressing. Without visual feedback, audiences miss important keyboard shortcuts.
</Callout>

## Quick Start

### At Startup

```bash
tuios --show-keys
```

### During Runtime

Toggle showkeys while TUIOS is running:

```
Ctrl+B D k           # Via debug prefix menu
```

### With Sessions

```bash
tuios new demo --show-keys
tuios attach demo
```

Showkeys state persists for the current session.

## What Gets Displayed

<Cards>
  <Card title="Basic Keys">
    Single keystrokes: `a`, `j`, `x`, `1`, `Space`, `Enter`, `Esc`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modifier Combinations">
    Combined keys: `Ctrl+C`, `Shift+Tab`, `Alt+1`, `Ctrl+Shift+T`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Action Names">
    What the key does: `n → new_window`, `t → toggle_tiling`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Key Repeats">
    Repeat counts: `j ×3`, `Down ×5`
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Special Keys Display

Common special keys show with readable names:

```
Tab    Enter    Esc    Backspace    Delete
Up     Down     Left   Right        Home    End
F1     F2       ...    F12
PgUp   PgDn     Insert
```

### Action Names

When a key triggers a TUIOS action, the action name appears:

```
n → new_window
t → toggle_tiling
Alt+2 → switch_workspace_2
Ctrl+B c → prefix_new_window
```

<Callout type="tip">
This helps viewers understand not just **what key** was pressed, but **what it did**.
</Callout>

## Display Format

### Overlay Position

The showkeys overlay appears at the bottom-center of the screen, above the status bar but below any windows.

### Ring Buffer

TUIOS shows the last 5 keystrokes by default. Older keys slide out as new ones arrive:

```
[Ctrl+B] [c] [i] [l] [s]
```

The history limit prevents clutter while providing enough context.

### Visual Styling

Keys appear in rounded boxes with theming that matches your current TUIOS theme. The overlay uses semi-transparent backgrounds to avoid completely obscuring terminal content.

## Use Cases

### Screencasting and Tutorials

Perfect for creating terminal tutorials where viewers need to see exactly what you're typing:

<Steps>

<Step>

Start TUIOS with showkeys:

```bash
tuios --show-keys
```

</Step>

<Step>

Start your screen capture tool (OBS, asciinema, etc.)

</Step>

<Step>

Perform your demo - viewers see both output and keystrokes

</Step>

</Steps>

###  Live Presentations

During conference talks or live coding sessions, showkeys lets audience members see your shortcuts:

```bash
tuios new presentation --show-keys --theme nord
```

Attendees can take notes on the specific keys you use without constantly asking "what did you just press?"

### Teaching and Onboarding

When teaching new developers how to use TUIOS or terminal workflows:

```bash
tuios --show-keys --theme github
```

Students see exactly how to navigate, create windows, and execute commands.

### Recording Demos

Capture animated demos for README files or documentation:

```bash
# Record with showkeys
tuios --show-keys
asciinema rec demo.cast

# Perform demo
# ...

exit
```

The resulting recording includes visible keystrokes, making it self-documenting.

### Debugging Keybindings

When troubleshooting keybinding conflicts or testing custom configurations:

```bash
tuios --show-keys --debug
```

Watch the overlay to confirm TUIOS receives the correct key events and resolves them to the expected actions.

## Configuration

### Theme Integration

Showkeys automatically adapts to your current theme. The overlay colors derive from your terminal's ANSI palette:

```bash
tuios --theme dracula --show-keys      # Purple/pink theme
tuios --theme nord --show-keys         # Blue/arctic theme
tuios --theme github --show-keys       # Light theme
```

No additional configuration needed - it just works.

### Hiding Sensitive Input

There's no filter to hide specific keys (e.g., passwords). If you're typing sensitive information, toggle showkeys off temporarily:

```
Ctrl+B D k               # Toggle off
# Type sensitive data
Ctrl+B D k               # Toggle back on
```

## Platform Support

Showkeys works identically across all platforms:

- **Linux**: Full support
- **macOS**: Full support (Option key shows as Alt)
- **Windows**: Full support
- **SSH**: Full support
- **Web Terminal**: Full support (tuios-web --show-keys)

## Technical Details

### Performance Impact

Showkeys has minimal overhead:

- **Memory**: ~1KB for key history
- **CPU**: < 0.1% per keystroke
- **Rendering**: No performance impact

Recording does not slow down terminal performance or increase latency.

### History Buffer

The default ring buffer shows 5 keys. This is currently hardcoded but may become configurable in future versions.

## Troubleshooting

### Overlay Not Appearing

<Steps>

<Step>

Check if enabled - status bar should show indicator

</Step>

<Step>

Toggle it:

```
Ctrl+B D k
```

</Step>

<Step>

Verify at startup:

```bash
tuios --show-keys
```

</Step>

</Steps>

### Keys Not Showing

**Modifier key issues**: Some terminals don't send all modifier combinations. For example, `Ctrl+Shift+letter` might arrive as just `Ctrl+letter`.

**Solution**: Use a terminal with proper keyboard protocol support (kitty, wezterm, alacritty).

**Key captured but no action name**: Not all keys map to TUIOS actions. Only keybindings configured in your config file show action names.

### Terminal Too Small

Showkeys needs at least 3 rows of vertical space. On very small terminals (< 20 rows), the overlay might be cut off.

**Solution**: Resize your terminal to at least 24 rows.

### Overlay Hard to Read

The overlay uses transparency. If it's hard to read over busy terminal output:

**Solution**: Toggle it off temporarily, or use a theme with higher contrast.

## Examples

### Example 1: Recording a Tutorial

<Steps>

<Step>

Start TUIOS with showkeys:

```bash
tuios --show-keys --theme github
```

</Step>

<Step>

Start recording:

```bash
asciinema rec tuios-demo.cast
```

</Step>

<Step>

Perform demo:
- Create windows with <kbd>n</kbd>
- Enable tiling with <kbd>t</kbd>
- Navigate with <kbd>Tab</kbd>
- Switch workspaces with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd>

</Step>

<Step>

Stop recording:

```bash
exit
```

</Step>

</Steps>

Result: A recording where viewers see every keystroke and its corresponding action.

### Example 2: Live Presentation

<Steps>

<Step>

Before audience arrives:

```bash
tuios new workshop --show-keys --theme nord
```

</Step>

<Step>

Maximize terminal window and adjust font size for visibility

</Step>

<Step>

Detach and prepare:

```
Ctrl+B d
```

</Step>

<Step>

When ready to present:

```bash
tuios attach workshop
```

Showkeys state persists in the session.

</Step>

</Steps>

### Example 3: Teaching Workflow

Instructor demonstrates TUIOS to students:

```bash
tuios --show-keys --theme dracula
```

Students watch and see:

```
n → new_window
i → enter_terminal_mode
Ctrl+B d → enter_window_mode
t → toggle_tiling
```

Students can follow along precisely.
